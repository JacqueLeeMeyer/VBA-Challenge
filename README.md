Module 2 Challenge - Jacqueline Meyer

#Sources:
I used Ed Xpert Learning Assistant to figure out how to make my percent column show 2 spaces after the decimal point.
  Although the example code given by Ed Xpert was not exactly what i needed, it gave me an idea of how to word my code in order to get where I needed to be. 

#Struggles:
I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to make Max and Min work in VBA for the Greatest % Increase and Decrease and Greatest Total Volume.
  I ended up using 3 different If statements instead.
  I would be interested to know what the "correct" way is.
    *Or if there is a more efficiant way to pull these vlaues out.
